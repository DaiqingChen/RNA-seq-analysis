# RNA-seq-analysis
When we talk about bulk RNA-seq analysis, there are plenty of tutorials everywhere telling about the standard workflow. But the problem for biologist is it's hard to figure out the purpose of each step, and then interpret the result. What's more, how to connect with the research and push it going forward.
This is my version of best practice. I also want to share some useful websites and tutorials that had helped me to brush up my knowledge in my journey.
